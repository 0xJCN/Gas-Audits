# Summary
A majority of the optimizations were benchmarked via the protocol's tests, i.e. using the following config: `solc version 0.8.13`, `optimizer on`, and `200 runs`. Optimizations that were not benchmarked are explained via EVM gas costs and opcodes.

Below are the overall average gas savings for the following tested functions, with all the optimizations applied:
| Function |    Before   |    After   | Avg Gas Savings |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| Equity.transfer |  85662  |  85527  |  135 | 
| Frankencoin.mint |  117324  |  116933  |  391 | 
| Frankencoin.transfer |  40359  |  40224  |  135 | 
| MintingHub.bid |  99969  |  97084  |  2885 |  
| MintingHub.end |  128303  |  121752  | 6551 | 
| MintingHub.launchChallenge |  211011  | 210751 | 260 | 
| Position.repay |  87902  |  82794  | 5108 | 
| Position.withdrawCollateral |  73058  |  69071  | 3987 | 
| StablecoinBridge.mint |  98219  |  97904  | 315 |  
| TestToken.transfer |  51749  |  51614  | 135 |  

**Total gas saved across all listed functions: 19902**

*Notes*: 

- The [Gas report](#gasreport-output-with-all-optimizations-applied) output, after all optimizations have been applied, can be found at the end of the report.
- The final diffs for each contract, with all the optimizations applied, can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/0xJCN/8c6388a742a495a024eef2ab7271d717).

## A mapping is more efficient than an array
Fetching data from an array is more expensive than fetching data from a mapping. Fetching data from an array will require iterating over the array until you reach your desired data. When using a mapping you only need to know the `key` in order to fetch the data from the exact slot it is stored in. [Source](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1464523336730480640)

## State variables can be cached instead of re-reading them from storage
Caching of a state variable replaces each `Gwarmaccess (100 gas)` with a much cheaper stack read.

## Refactor code to avoid re-reading from storage
The internal functions below read storage slots that are previously read in the functions that invoke them. We can refactor the internal functions so we could pass cached storage variables as stack variables and avoid the extra storage reads that would otherwise take place in the internal functions.

## Cache return value from external call to avoid an unnecessary CALL/STATICCALL
External calls are expensive as they use the `CALL/STATICCALL` opcode (~100 gas). If you are calling the same external function more than once you should cache the return value to avoid an unnecessary `CALL/STATICCALL`.

## Refactor event to avoid emitting unnecessary storage values that don't change
The `limit` storage variable is only modified in the constructor, the `initializeClone` function, and the `reduceLimitForClone` function. Likewise, the `price` storage variable is only modified in the constructor, the `initilizeClone` function, and the `adjustPrice` function. Instead of using the `MintingUpdate` event (which emits the `limit` and `price` storage variables) in functions that do not modify `limit` and `price`, we can create a new event that opts out of emitting those excessive storage variables. 

**Note: Only `repay` and `withdrawCollateral` undergo this optimization since those are the only functions that are benchmarked in the tests. This optimization can also be done for other functions that call `emitUpdate` and do not modify the `limit` and `price` storage variables**.
